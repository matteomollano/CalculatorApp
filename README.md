# CalculatorApp

This project contains the XCode build and source code for my Calculator App, created using storyboard and Swift.

This project uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm, in which the View (storyboard) communicates with the Model of the program (CalcBrain.swift)
through the functions in the View Controller.

The CalcBrain.swift file contains various functions that help operate the calculator. These include:
- Clear
- Negate
- Adding numbers to the expression
- Adding operators to the expression
- Equal to solve the expression
